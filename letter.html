Hey Misa❤️❤️, I hope this letter finds you well. I’ve been meaning to talk to you for a while now, but I guess I’ve been too scared to bring it up. I just want to say that I’m really sorry if I’ve done anything to upset you or make you feel uncomfortable. It’s been on my mind a lot lately, and I can’t help but feel worried about our friendship.

I honestly don’t know if I’ve done something wrong, but I just want to say I’m really sorry if I hurt you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly. It’s been bothering me that you’ve been snubbing my messages, and I can’t lie it makes me feel worried because I value our friendship a lot.

If I said or did anything that upset you, please don’t keep it to yourself. I would really appreciate it if you could tell me, because the last thing I would ever want is to hurt you or make you uncomfortable. I’m human, and I can make mistakes sometimes, but I’m always willing to listen, understand, and make things right.

Your silence is honestly harder for me than knowing the problem itself. Please talk to me and let me know what’s going on. I truly care about our friendship, and I don’t want misunderstandings to create distance between us.

I’m really sorry once again, and I’m here whenever you’re ready to talk.🤍❤️❤️,
